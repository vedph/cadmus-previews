      <_md>The *Fort Vancouver Centennial* half dollar is a commemorative fifty-cent piece struck
         by
         the United States Bureau of the Mint in 1925 in honor of the founding of Fort Vancouver
         in
         present-day Vancouver, Washington. The obverse of the commemorative coin (pictured)
         depicts
         John McLoughlin, who built the fort for the Hudson's Bay Company in 1825. The reverse
         shows
         an armed frontiersman standing in front of the fort. Representative Albert Johnson
         of
         Washington state was able to get Congress to authorize a coin for Fort Vancouver's
         centennial celebrations, and President Calvin Coolidge signed the authorizing act
         on
         February 24, 1925. Laura Gardin Fraser was engaged to design the coin on the recommendation
         of the United States Commission of Fine Arts. The coins were struck at the San Francisco
         Mint, and then were flown to Washington state by airplane as a publicity stunt. They
         sold
         badly, and are valuable today since few of the coins survive.</_md>
