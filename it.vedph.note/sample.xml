    <text>The *Fort Vancouver Centennial* half dollar is a commemorative fifty-cent piece struck by
        the United States Bureau of the Mint in 1925 in honor of the founding of Fort Vancouver in
        present-day Vancouver, Washington. The obverse of the commemorative coin (pictured) depicts
        John McLoughlin, who built the fort for the Hudson's Bay Company in 1825. The reverse shows
        an armed frontiersman standing in front of the fort. Representative Albert Johnson of
        Washington state was able to get Congress to authorize a coin for Fort Vancouver's
        centennial celebrations, and President Calvin Coolidge signed the authorizing act on
        February 24, 1925. Laura Gardin Fraser was engaged to design the coin on the recommendation
        of the United States Commission of Fine Arts. The coins were struck at the San Francisco
        Mint, and then were flown to Washington state by airplane as a publicity stunt. They sold
        badly, and are valuable today since few of the coins survive.</text>
